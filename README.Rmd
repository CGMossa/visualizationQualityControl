# Visualization Quality Control

Set of useful functions for calculating various measures from data and visualizing them.

## Installation

### Dependencies

Note that before installing, you will want to install the `ggbiplot` package, and at least `v1.2.1` of the `ComplexHeatmap` package. Robert M Flight maintains a fork of `ggbiplot` on GitHub because it is not part of CRAN, and as of July 2, 2015, `ComplexHeatmap` must be installed from GitHub:

```r
devtools::install_github("rmflight/ggbiplot")
devtools::install_github("jokergoo/ComplexHeatmap")
```

Other odd dependencies that may not be present include the `dendsort` package:

```r
install.packages("dendsort")
```

### This Package

This package can be installed by cloning from the GitLab repo:

```r
git clone https://gitlab.cesb.uky.edu/rmflight/visualizationQualityControl.git
cd visualizationQualityControl
R
devtools::install()
```
