Visualization Quality Control
=============================

Set of useful functions for calculating various measures from data and
visualizing them.

Installation
------------

### Dependencies

Note that before installing, you will want to install the `ggbiplot`
package, and at least `v1.2.1` of the `ComplexHeatmap` package. Robert M
Flight maintains a fork of `ggbiplot` on GitHub because it is not part
of CRAN, and as of July 2, 2015, `ComplexHeatmap` must be installed from
GitHub:

    devtools::install_github("rmflight/ggbiplot")
    devtools::install_github("jokergoo/ComplexHeatmap")

Other odd dependencies that may not be present include the `dendsort`
package, and the `viridis` package:

    install.packages("dendsort")
    install.packages("viridis")

### This Package

This package can be installed by cloning from the GitLab repo:

    git clone https://gitlab.cesb.uky.edu/rmflight/visualizationQualityControl.git
    cd visualizationQualityControl
    R
    devtools::install(".", quick = FALSE) # builds the vignette, which you definitely want

Fake Data Generation
--------------------

Some fake data is stored in `grp_cor_data` that is useful for testing
the `median_correlation` function. It was generated by:

    library(fakeDataWithError)
    set.seed(1234)

    s1 <- runif(100, 0, 1)
    grp1 <- add_uniform_noise(10, s1, 0.1)

    model_data <- data.frame(s1 = s1, s2 = grp1[, 1])

    lm_1 <- lm(s1 ~ s2, data = model_data)

    lm_1$coefficients[2] <- 0.5

    s3 <- predict(lm_1)
    s4 <- add_uniform_noise(1, s3, 0.2)

    grp2 <- add_uniform_noise(10, s4, 0.1)

    grp_class <- rep(c("grp1", "grp2"), each = 10)

    grp_cor_data <- list(data = cbind(grp1, grp2), class = grp_class)
