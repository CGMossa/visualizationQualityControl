#' keep features with percentage of non-zeros
#' 
#' Given a value matrix (features are columns, samples are rows), and sample classes, 
#' find those things that are \emph{not zero} in at least a certain 
#' number of samples in one of the classes, and keep those features for further
#' processing.
#' 
#' @param data_matrix the matrix of values to work with 
#' @param sample_classes the classes of each sample
#' @param keep_num what number of samples in each class need a non-zero value (see Details)
#' 
#' @details The number of samples that must be non-zero can be expressed either as a whole
#'   number (that is greater than one), or as a fraction that will be be multiplied 
#'   by the number of samples in each class to get the lower limits for each of the classes.
